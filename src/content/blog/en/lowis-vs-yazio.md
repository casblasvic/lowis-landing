Looking for the best app to track your nutrition? Yazio is one of the most popular apps in Europe, with its integrated recipes and colorful interface. But is it really the best option to reach your goals?

**In this article, we honestly compare LOWIS and Yazio** to help you make the choice that truly fits your needs.

## The 30-Second Summary

| Criterion | LOWIS | Yazio |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Price** | 7-day free trial, then ~$12/week | ~$50/year (Pro version) |
| **AI Photo Scan** | ✅ Recognizes complete meals | ⚠️ Barcode scan only |
| **Indicators Tracked** | 40+ (sleep, stress, cycle...) | Calories + macros |
| **Personalized Coaching** | ✅ Active AI | ❌ Generic advice |
| **Local Database** | ✅ 500+ local dishes | ⚠️ European, limited |
| **Integrated Recipes** | ✅ Adapted to your needs | ✅ Large library |

## Yazio: What This App Does Well

Let's be fair — Yazio has strengths:

### Yazio's Advantages

1. **Colorful, pleasant interface**: The app is visually attractive with clear graphs
2. **Recipe library**: Hundreds of recipes with pre-calculated nutritional values
3. **Accessible price**: ~$50/year for the Pro version, one of the most affordable
4. **Active community**: Forums and recipe sharing between users
5. **Intermittent fasting plans**: Fasting integration in the app

### Where Yazio Reaches Its Limits

Despite these positives, here's what users often criticize about Yazio:

> "I have to search everything manually, it's time-consuming and discouraging."

> "My grandmother's recipes don't exist in the database."

> "The app tells me my calories but never tells me WHAT to change."

> "After 3 months, I was still getting the same generic advice."

## The Real Difference: Counter vs Coach

### Yazio: A Smart Calorie Counter

Yazio does its counting job well:
- You search for your foods
- You log your portions
- The app calculates your calories and macros
- You see if you're meeting your goals

It's useful, but **you're doing the analysis work yourself**.

### LOWIS: A Coach That Works for You

LOWIS goes further:
- **You scan** — 2 seconds, even a complete meal
- **The AI analyzes** — not just calories, but 40+ indicators
- **The coach recommends** — "Today you slept poorly, here's how to adapt your eating"
- **The system learns** — your corrections improve future analyses

## Detailed Feature Comparison
