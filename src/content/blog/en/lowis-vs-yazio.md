## Yazio: What This App Does Well

Let's be fair — Yazio has strengths:

### Yazio's Advantages

1. **Colorful, pleasant interface**: The app is visually attractive with clear graphs
2. **Recipe library**: Hundreds of recipes with pre-calculated nutritional values
3. **Accessible price**: ~$50/year for the Pro version, one of the most affordable

## The Real Difference: Counter vs Coach

### Yazio: A Smart Calorie Counter

Yazio does its counting job well:
- You search for your foods
- You log your portions
- The app calculates your calories and macros

It's useful, but **you're doing the analysis work yourself**.

### LOWIS: A Coach That Works for You

LOWIS goes further:
- **You scan** — 2 seconds, even a complete meal
- **The AI analyzes** — not just calories, but 40+ indicators
- **The coach recommends** — "Today you slept poorly, here's how to adapt your eating"
- **The system learns** — your corrections improve future analyses
