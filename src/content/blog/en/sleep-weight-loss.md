faq:
  - question: "How many hours of sleep to lose weight?"
    answer: "To optimize weight loss, aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Below 7 hours, hunger hormones are disrupted, metabolism slows, and sugar cravings increase significantly."
  - question: "Does lack of sleep really cause weight gain?"
    answer: "Yes, scientifically proven. Sleep deprivation increases ghrelin (+15%, hunger hormone), decreases leptin (-20%, satiety hormone), raises cortisol (fat storage), and slows basal metabolism."
  - question: "Can you lose weight by sleeping more?"
    answer: "Improving sleep can effectively accelerate weight loss. Studies show people sleeping 7-8h lose 55% more fat than those sleeping less than 6h, on the same diet."

You're doing everything right. You're counting your calories, exercising, avoiding snacks. And yet, the scale refuses to budge.

**What if the problem isn't on your plate, but in your bed?**

Sleep is the most neglected — yet most powerful — factor in weight loss. Here's why, and more importantly, what you can do about it.

## The Science of Sleep and Weight

### What Happens When You Sleep Poorly

When you sleep less than 7 hours, your body triggers a cascade of hormonal effects that directly sabotage your weight loss:

**1. Ghrelin Spikes (+15%)**
- This is the hunger hormone
- It pushes you to eat more
- Especially high-calorie foods

**2. Leptin Drops (-20%)**
- This is the satiety hormone
- You never feel "full"
- You eat beyond your needs

**3. Cortisol Rises**
- This is the stress hormone
- It promotes abdominal fat storage
- It increases sugar cravings

**4. Insulin Becomes Less Effective**
- Increased insulin resistance
- Sugar is more easily stored as fat

### The Numbers That Make You Think

| Sleep Duration | Impact on Weight Loss |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Less than 5h | +55% obesity risk |
| 5-6h | +23% obesity risk |
| 7-8h | Reference risk |
| More than 9h | +21% obesity risk |

**The Key Study**: Researchers followed two groups in identical calorie deficit.
- Group A: 8.5h of sleep → -3.1 kg of fat
- Group B: 5.5h of sleep → -1.4 kg of fat (55% less!)

Same diet, radically different results.

## Why You Eat More When Tired

### It's Biological, Not Personal Failure

When you're tired, your brain pushes you toward caloric foods. It's not lack of willpower — it's survival.

**The mechanism:**
1. Lack of sleep = lack of energy
2. Brain seeks quick energy
3. Sugary/fatty foods are most "efficient"
4. Reward system activates (+24% activity)
5. You give in to cravings

**Average result**: +385 calories consumed per day of poor sleep.

## The Sleep-Weight Vicious Cycle

### How It Gets Established

The vicious cycle develops progressively:

### How to Break the Cycle

The good news: improving your sleep can trigger a virtuous cycle:

## The 7 Pillars of Weight-Loss Sleep

### 1. Regularity (Most Important)

**The problem**: Irregular bedtime and wake times
**The solution**: Same time ±30min, even on weekends

### 2. Environment

**Temperature**: 60-65°F (16-18°C) ideally
**Darkness**: Total (mask if needed)
**Silence**: Earplugs or white noise
**Screens**: Out of the bedroom

### 3. Evening Nutrition

**Avoid after 6pm:**
- Caffeine (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate)
- Alcohol (disrupts deep sleep)
- Heavy meals
- Quick sugars

**Prioritize:**
- Light dinner 3h before bed
- Tryptophan-rich foods (turkey, banana, nuts)
- Chamomile or valerian tea

### 4. Physical Activity

**Yes but**: No intense exercise 3h before bed
**Ideal**: Exercise in morning or early afternoon

### 5. Pre-Sleep Routine

30-60 minutes before bed:
1. Dim the lights
2. Turn off screens
3. Relaxing activity (reading, warm bath)
4. Next day prep (reduces anxiety)

### 6. Stress Management

Stress is sleep's #1 enemy:
- Guided meditation (5-10 min)
- 4-7-8 breathing
- Gratitude journal

### 7. Strategic Napping

**If needed**: 20 minutes max, before 3pm

### Why LOWIS Tracks Your Sleep

Most nutrition apps ignore sleep. That's a major mistake.

**LOWIS tracks:**
- ⏰ Sleep duration
- 💤 Perceived quality
- ⚡ Morning energy level
- 📊 Correlation with your results

**What it enables:**
- Understanding why you don't lose certain weeks
- Adjusting calorie goals based on your sleep
- Anticipating high-risk days for slip-ups
- Personalizing recommendations

## Immediate Action Plan

### This Week

**Day 1-2**: Assessment
- Note your actual bedtime/wake times
- Rate your energy 1-10 each morning

**Day 3-4**: Environment
- Optimize your bedroom (temperature, light)
- Remove screens

**Day 5-7**: Routine
- Set a realistic bedtime
- Create a 30-min pre-sleep routine

## Conclusion: Sleep Is Not a Luxury

In our society that values "hustle" and "I'll sleep when I'm dead," prioritizing sleep can seem counterproductive.

**It's exactly the opposite.**

Sleep is the multiplier for all your efforts:
- It optimizes your metabolism
- It regulates your hormones
- It improves your food choices
- It boosts your energy for exercise

**The question isn't "do I have time to sleep 7-8h?" but "do I have time NOT to?"**
