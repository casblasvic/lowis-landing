faq:
  - question: "What is the main difference between LOWIS and Cal AI?"
    answer: "The major difference is the approach: Cal AI is a passive calorie counter that leaves you to do the work, while LOWIS is an active AI coach that analyzes 40+ indicators and personally guides you toward your goals."
  - question: "Is Cal AI really cheaper than LOWIS?"
    answer: "Cal AI costs about $50/year vs ~$40/month for LOWIS. However, Cal AI requires 15+ minutes of manual work per day. If your time is worth $15/hour, you 'lose' $110/month in time. LOWIS saves you that time with 2-second analysis."
  - question: "Can I get a refund with Cal AI?"
    answer: "According to many user reviews, Cal AI has a very strict refund policy. Many users report being unable to get their money back. LOWIS offers a 7-day free trial without credit card and a clear refund policy."
  - question: "Does Cal AI recognize Moroccan and French dishes?"
    answer: "Cal AI has a primarily American database. Dishes like tagine, couscous, harira or msemen are often missing or poorly recognized. LOWIS includes 500+ Moroccan recipes and a complete database of international dishes."
  - question: "Does LOWIS really use AI?"
    answer: "Yes, LOWIS uses advanced AI models (GPT-4, Claude) for each analysis. This AI doesn't just recognize foods, it analyzes your overall situation (sleep, stress, hormonal cycle) and provides personalized recommendations in real-time."
  - question: "Is there customer support at Cal AI?"
    answer: "According to numerous reviews on TrustPilot and Reddit, Cal AI doesn't have an easily accessible support button. Users report difficulties contacting the team. LOWIS has responsive customer support and weekly validation by nutritionists."

You've probably already heard of Cal AI, the calorie counting app that promises to scan your meals with a photo. But is it really the best option? Spoiler: not necessarily.

**In this article, we honestly compare LOWIS and Cal AI** to help you make the right choice — the one that will actually make you lose weight, not just the one with nice advertisements.

## The 30-second summary

| Criteria | LOWIS | Cal AI |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Price** | Free trial, then ~$10/week | ~$50/year (no real trial) |
| **Refund** | Yes, easy | Difficult to impossible |
| **AI Accuracy** | Learns from your corrections | Frequent errors reported |
| **Active AI coach** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Local database** | ✅ Moroccan/French dishes | ❌ Primarily US |
| **Customer support** | ✅ Responsive | ❌ Non-existent per reviews |

## Why look for an alternative to Cal AI?

Before going further, let's look at what real Cal AI users say. These comments come directly from TrustPilot and Reddit:

> "50 bucks down the drain. Had they provided a free trial, I would have cancelled immediately."

> "I feel totally scammed, I can't get my money back."

> "18oz steak showing 23,000 calories — completely wrong."

> "There is no button for support or help anywhere."

These problems come up constantly:
- **High price** without a real free trial
- **No refund** even if the app doesn't suit you
- **Significant calculation errors**
- **No accessible customer support**

If you've experienced these frustrations, you're not alone. And that's exactly why [so many people are looking for an alternative to Cal AI](/blog/free-calorie-apps-fail/).

## The real difference: Passive AI vs Active AI

Here's what many don't understand: **not all "AI" is equal**.

### Cal AI: Passive AI

Cal AI uses AI to **recognize** what you eat. That's it. After that, it's up to you to:
- Search for foods in the database (if they exist)
- Correct errors (frequent)
- Calculate if you're within your goals
- Decide what to eat next
- Adjust your plan if you're not losing weight

In summary: **you do the work, the app records**.

### LOWIS: Active AI

LOWIS uses AI in a radically different way:

1. **Photo recognition** — Yes, like Cal AI
2. **But also**: Coach that analyzes 40+ indicators (sleep, stress, cycle, digestion...)
3. **That adapts** to your results in real-time
4. **That tells you what to eat** — not just what you've eaten
5. **With nutritionists** who validate your plan every week

In summary: **the AI works for you, not the other way around**.

## The real cost: Time vs Money

Let's talk frankly about price. Cal AI seems cheaper: about $50 per year versus $10 per week for LOWIS.

But let's ask the real question: **how much time do you spend?**

### With Cal AI (and similar apps)

- 15 min/day searching for foods
- 10 min/day correcting errors
- Frustration when your dishes don't exist
- **= 7-8 hours per month**

If your time is worth $15/hour, that's **$110 of lost time per month**.

### With LOWIS

- Photo of your meal: 2 seconds
- AI analyzes and advises: automatic
- **= 5 minutes per day maximum**

The real savings isn't on the app price, but on your time. And your time is your life.

## Why LOWIS costs more (and why it's worth it)

Let's be transparent: LOWIS uses **real advanced AI models** (GPT-4, Claude) for each analysis. These APIs cost money with each use.

"Cheaper" apps like Cal AI:
- Use basic image recognition models
- Have no personalized coaching
- Leave you to do the work

It's like comparing a **personal trainer** to a **notebook**. Both have their place, but the results aren't the same.

- You mainly eat **standard American/international dishes**
- You're comfortable with **manual counting** and corrections
- Budget is your **only priority** (and you accept the risk of not being refunded)

### Choose LOWIS if:

## What users who switched say

Here's what we often hear from users who moved from Cal AI to LOWIS:

> "I wasted 3 weeks with Cal AI searching for tagines in their database. With LOWIS, I scan and I'm done." — Fatima, Casablanca

> "The price made me hesitate, but when I calculated the time I was losing... LOWIS is actually cheaper." — Marc, Paris

> "Finally an app that understands I eat msemen for breakfast, not American pancakes." — Karim, Rabat

## Our honest verdict

**Cal AI** is a decent app for basic calorie counting, but its accuracy problems, lack of customer support, and strict refund policy make it a risky choice.

**LOWIS** costs more in appearance, but offers real AI support that works for you. If your goal is to **actually lose weight** (and not just count calories), it's the most worthwhile investment.

The question isn't "which app costs less?" but "which app will help me reach my goals?"
