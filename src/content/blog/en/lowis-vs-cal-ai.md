  - question: "What is the main difference between LOWIS and Cal AI?"
    answer: "Cal AI is a passive calorie counter. LOWIS is an <a href='/en/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/'>active AI coach</a> that analyzes <a href='/en/blog/40-indicators-weight-loss/'>40+ indicators</a>. That's <a href='/en/blog/free-calorie-apps-fail/'>why passive apps fail</a>."
  - question: "Is Cal AI really cheaper than LOWIS?"
    answer: "Cal AI costs ~$50/year but requires 15+ min/day of manual work. LOWIS <a href='/en/blog/scan-meal-2-seconds/'>scans meals in 2 seconds</a>. Read <a href='/en/blog/how-to-choose-nutrition-app/'>how to choose a nutrition app</a> for the real cost calculation."
  - question: "Does Cal AI track sleep and stress?"
    answer: "No. Cal AI only counts calories. But <a href='/en/blog/sleep-weight-loss/'>sleep</a> and <a href='/en/blog/stress-weight-loss/'>stress</a> are crucial — it's <a href='/en/blog/why-diets-fail/'>why diets fail</a>. LOWIS tracks these with its <a href='/en/blog/40-indicators-weight-loss/'>40+ indicators</a>."
  - question: "Does Cal AI help with menstrual cycle?"
    answer: "No. The <a href='/en/blog/menstrual-cycle-weight-loss/'>menstrual cycle</a> affects weight by 1-3kg. LOWIS adapts recommendations to your cycle phase. The <a href='/en/blog/audio-program-reprogram-brain/'>Audio Program</a> also helps with cravings."
  - question: "How do I avoid weight rebound after using an app?"
    answer: "Apps that only count calories don't prevent the <a href='/en/blog/avoid-weight-rebound/'>rebound effect</a>. Read our <a href='/en/blog/smart-weight-loss-guide/'>complete guide</a> and see why an <a href='/en/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/'>AI coach</a> makes the difference."

You've probably already heard of Cal AI, the calorie counting app that promises to scan your meals with a photo. But is it really the best option? Spoiler: not necessarily.

**In this article, we honestly compare LOWIS and Cal AI** to help you make the right choice — the one that will actually make you lose weight, not just the one with nice advertisements.

## The 30-second summary

| Criteria | LOWIS | Cal AI |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Price** | Free trial, then ~$10/week | ~$50/year (no real trial) |
| **Refund** | Yes, easy | Difficult to impossible |
| **AI Accuracy** | Learns from your corrections | Frequent errors reported |
| **Active AI coach** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Local database** | ✅ Moroccan/French dishes | ❌ Primarily US |
| **Customer support** | ✅ Responsive | ❌ Non-existent per reviews |

## Why look for an alternative to Cal AI?

Before going further, let's look at what real Cal AI users say. These comments come directly from TrustPilot and Reddit:

> "50 bucks down the drain. Had they provided a free trial, I would have cancelled immediately."

> "I feel totally scammed, I can't get my money back."

> "18oz steak showing 23,000 calories — completely wrong."

> "There is no button for support or help anywhere."

These problems come up constantly:
- **High price** without a real free trial
- **No refund** even if the app doesn't suit you
- **Significant calculation errors**
- **No accessible customer support**

If you've experienced these frustrations, you're not alone. And that's exactly why [so many people are looking for an alternative to Cal AI](/en/blog/free-calorie-apps-fail/).

## The real difference: Passive AI vs Active AI

Here's what many don't understand: **not all "AI" is equal**.

### Cal AI: Passive AI

Cal AI uses AI to **recognize** what you eat. That's it. After that, it's up to you to:
- Search for foods in the database (if they exist)
- Correct errors (frequent)
- Calculate if you're within your goals
- Decide what to eat next
- Adjust your plan if you're not losing weight

In summary: **you do the work, the app records**.

### LOWIS: Active AI

LOWIS uses AI in a radically different way:

1. **Photo recognition** — Yes, like Cal AI
2. **But also**: Coach that analyzes 40+ indicators (sleep, stress, cycle, digestion...)
3. **That adapts** to your results in real-time
4. **That tells you what to eat** — not just what you've eaten
5. **With nutritionists** who validate your plan every week

In summary: **the AI works for you, not the other way around**.

## The real cost: Time vs Money

Let's talk frankly about price. Cal AI seems cheaper: about $50 per year versus $10 per week for LOWIS.

But let's ask the real question: **how much time do you spend?**

### With Cal AI (and similar apps)

- 15 min/day searching for foods
- 10 min/day correcting errors
- Frustration when your dishes don't exist
- **= 7-8 hours per month**

If your time is worth $15/hour, that's **$110 of lost time per month**.

### With LOWIS

- Photo of your meal: 2 seconds
- AI analyzes and advises: automatic
- **= 5 minutes per day maximum**

The real savings isn't on the app price, but on your time. And your time is your life.

## Why LOWIS costs more (and why it's worth it)

Let's be transparent: LOWIS uses **real advanced AI models** (GPT-4, Claude) for each analysis. These APIs cost money with each use.

"Cheaper" apps like Cal AI:
- Use basic image recognition models
- Have no personalized coaching
- Leave you to do the work

It's like comparing a **personal trainer** to a **notebook**. Both have their place, but the results aren't the same.

## Who is each app for?

### Choose Cal AI if:

- You have **lots of time** to dedicate to tracking
- You mainly eat **standard American/international dishes**
- You're comfortable with **manual counting** and corrections
- Budget is your **only priority** (and you accept the risk of not being refunded)

### Choose LOWIS if:

- You want **results** without spending hours
- You eat **Moroccan or local dishes**
- You need **personalized support**

- You want a **real free trial** before committing

## What users who switched say

Here's what we often hear from users who moved from Cal AI to LOWIS:

> "I wasted 3 weeks with Cal AI searching for tagines in their database. With LOWIS, I scan and I'm done." — Fatima, Casablanca

> "The price made me hesitate, but when I calculated the time I was losing... LOWIS is actually cheaper." — Marc, Paris

> "Finally an app that understands I eat msemen for breakfast, not American pancakes." — Karim, Rabat

## Our honest verdict

**Cal AI** is a decent app for basic calorie counting, but its accuracy problems, lack of customer support, and strict refund policy make it a risky choice.

**LOWIS** costs more in appearance, but offers real AI support that works for you. If your goal is to **actually lose weight** (and not just count calories), it's the most worthwhile investment.

The question isn't "which app costs less?" but "which app will help me reach my goals?"
