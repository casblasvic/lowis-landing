faq:
  - question: "Can stress really prevent weight loss?"
    answer: "Yes. Cortisol (the stress hormone) promotes fat storage, especially abdominal fat, increases appetite for fatty and sugary foods, and slows metabolism. That's why some people don't lose weight despite a calorie deficit."
  - question: "How do I know if stress is blocking my weight loss?"
    answer: "Tell-tale signs: you crave sugar/fat at the end of the day, you eat without real hunger, your fat concentrates around your belly, you sleep poorly, you have low energy despite enough calories. LOWIS analyzes these indicators for you."
  - question: "What should I do when I eat because of stress?"
    answer: "First, stop feeling guilty — it's a normal biological response. Then: identify your triggers, prepare satisfying but healthy alternatives, and address the source of stress. LOWIS helps you identify these patterns and suggests adapted solutions."
  - question: "Does exercise help reduce stress?"
    answer: "Yes, but be careful: overly intense exercise can increase cortisol in the short term. Prioritize walking, yoga, swimming, or a sport you ENJOY. The goal is to move without creating additional stress."
  - question: "How long does it take to reduce cortisol?"
    answer: "With lifestyle changes (sleep, nutrition, stress management), cortisol levels can improve within 2-4 weeks. Weight loss then becomes easier. LOWIS tracks these indicators and adapts your recommendations."

You're doing everything right. You're counting your calories. You're moving. And yet... **the scale won't budge**.

Before blaming your metabolism or restricting yourself even more, ask yourself this question: **Are you stressed?**

Because here's what no one tells you: chronic stress can **completely block** your weight loss, even if you're in a perfect calorie deficit.

## Cortisol: The Hormone Sabotaging Your Efforts

When you're stressed, your body produces cortisol. It's a survival response inherited from our ancestors. The problem? Our body doesn't distinguish a work deadline from a tiger chasing us.

### What Cortisol Does to Your Body

| Effect | Weight Consequence |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Fat storage** | Especially abdominal (the most dangerous fat) |
| **Increased appetite** | Cravings for sugar, salt, fat — "comfort foods" |
| **Insulin resistance** | Your body stores carbs more easily |
| **Muscle breakdown** | Less muscle = slower metabolism |
| **Sleep disruption** | And [poor sleep](/blog/sleep-weight-loss/) makes stress worse |
| **Water retention** | Cortisol makes you bloated |

**Result?** You can be in a 500-calorie deficit and **not lose a single gram** if your cortisol is chronically elevated.

### The 7 Signs Stress Is Blocking Your Weight Loss

1. **End-of-day cravings** — After a stressful day, you MUST eat something comforting
2. **Resistant belly fat** — You lose everywhere except your belly
3. **Eating without hunger** — You eat to "unwind," not from physical hunger
4. **Constant fatigue** — Despite enough calories and sleep
5. **Disrupted sleep** — Difficulty falling asleep or night wakings
6. **Irritability** — Everything annoys you more easily
7. **Weight plateau** — Despite a deficit, nothing moves for weeks

**If you recognize yourself in 3+ of these signs, stress is probably your main problem.**

## Why Restrictive Diets Make Stress Worse

Think the solution is to restrict yourself even more? Bad idea.

### Restriction = More Cortisol

When you underfeed your body:
- It perceives this as a **survival threat**
- It increases cortisol production
- Your appetite explodes
- You binge
- You feel guilty
- You restrict even more
- **And the cycle restarts**

That's why [restrictive diets fail](/blog/how-to-choose-nutrition-app/) long-term for 95% of people.

## The Solution: Treat Stress BEFORE Calories

### Strategy 1: Identify Your Triggers

Keep a journal for a week. Note:
- What you ate
- WHEN you ate
- HOW you felt BEFORE eating

You'll see patterns emerge: "I eat chocolate at 5 PM when I've had a stressful meeting."

**LOWIS does this automatically** — the AI detects correlations between your stress and eating behaviors.

### Strategy 2: Prepare "Survival Alternatives"

When stress hits, you don't have the capacity to make rational choices. Prepare in advance:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| Chips | Salted nuts + a few olives |
| Milk chocolate | 2 squares of 85% chocolate + a date |
| Pastries | Greek yogurt + honey + fruit |
| Fast food | Pre-prepared meal that just needs reheating |

The goal isn't perfection — it's **limiting the damage** when stress hits.

### Strategy 3: Anti-Stress Movement (Not Punishing Exercise)

Intense exercise can **increase** cortisol. When you're very stressed, prioritize:

| Type | Effect on Cortisol |
|------|-------------------|
| Walking in nature | ↓↓ Very effective |
| Yoga / Stretching | ↓↓ Very effective |
| Swimming | ↓ Effective |
| Dancing (for fun) | ↓ Effective |
| Intense HIIT | ↑ Can increase short-term |
| Heavy weight training | ↑ Can increase short-term |

**Simple rule**: If exercise leaves you exhausted and stressed, it's counterproductive.

### Strategy 4: Protect Your Sleep

[Sleep and weight loss](/blog/sleep-weight-loss/) are intimately connected. One night of poor sleep:
- Increases cortisol by 37%
- Increases ghrelin (hunger hormone)
- Decreases leptin (satiety hormone)
- Reduces your willpower

**Absolute priority**: 7-8h of sleep, even if it means less exercise time.

### Strategy 5: Don't Count Calories on Extreme Stress Days

This may seem counterintuitive, but here's the logic:

On a high-stress day, your body is in survival mode. If you restrict on top of that:
- Cortisol ↑↑↑
- Uncontrollable cravings
- Massive binge
- Guilt
- More stress

**It's better** to eat a bit more (200-300 cal) in a controlled way than to crash into 1500 cal of junk food.

## How LOWIS Accounts for Your Stress

### 1. Daily Stress Level Tracking
A simple note from 1-10 each day is enough. The AI learns your patterns.

### 2. Adaptive Calorie Goals
Intense stress day? LOWIS slightly increases your goal rather than pushing you to crash.

### 3. "Healthy Comfort Food" Recipes
Recipes that satisfy the need for comfort without sabotaging your efforts.

### 4. Pattern Detection

### 5. Holistic Recommendations
Not just "eat less" — but "your stress is high, prioritize sleep tonight, and here's a comforting 400-cal recipe."

## The 4-Week Anti-Stress Plan

### Week 1: Observe
- Note your stress every day (1-10)
- Note when you eat without hunger
- Don't change anything else

### Week 2: Sleep

- Add 10 min of stretching in the evening
- Listen to your body

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "I can't reduce my stress — work, kids, etc."

You can't eliminate stress, but you can improve your **response** to stress:
- Deep breathing (even 2 minutes)
- 10-min walk after lunch
- Priority on sleep
- **Don't add the stress of food restriction**

### "I need to eat when I'm stressed"

It's biological. Sugar activates pleasure receptors and temporarily reduces cortisol. **Don't feel guilty.** Prepare less caloric alternatives that satisfy that need.

### "How do I know if my cortisol is really high?"

A blood test can confirm it, but the signs are clear: belly fat, sugar cravings, fatigue with nervousness, poor sleep. LOWIS analyzes these behavioral indicators.
