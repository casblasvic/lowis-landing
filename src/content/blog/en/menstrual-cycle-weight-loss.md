  - question: "Should I avoid weighing myself during my period?"

If you're a woman trying to lose weight, you've probably experienced this frustrating scenario:

You follow your plan perfectly for two weeks. The scale goes down. Then, suddenly, **+2 kg (4+ lbs) in 3 days**. Discouragement. You give up.

**The truth?** Those 2 kg aren't fat. It's your menstrual cycle doing its job. And if you understand how it works, you can transform this "weakness" into an advantage.

## Why Doesn't Anyone Explain This?

Most nutrition apps treat the female body like a male body. Same calorie goals every day. Same advice. No consideration for the **hormonal variations** that affect:

- Your metabolism (up to 300 calories difference)
- Your appetite (natural increase of 200-500 cal/day)
- Your water retention (1-3 kg / 2-6 lb fluctuation)
- Your cravings (sugar, salt, fat)
- Your energy and motivation

**This is why "one-size-fits-all" diets fail for 78% of women.**

## The 4 Phases of Your Cycle (and How to Use Them)

Your menstrual cycle averages 28 days (but can range from 21 to 35 days). Each phase has its own hormonal and nutritional characteristics.

### Phase 1: Menstruation (Days 1-5)

**What's happening hormonally:**
- Estrogen and progesterone at their lowest
- Shedding of uterine lining
- Mild inflammation in the body

**What you feel:**
- Fatigue, sometimes pain
- Appetite often reduced in the first days
- Need for comfort

**Nutritional strategy:**

| Foods to prioritize | Why |
|--------------------|-----|
| Iron (red meat, lentils, spinach) | Compensate for blood loss |
| Anti-inflammatories (turmeric, ginger, fatty fish) | Reduce cramps |
| Magnesium (dark chocolate, almonds) | Relax muscles |
| Extra hydration | Avoid dehydration |

**What LOWIS adjusts:**
- Slightly reduced calorie goal (naturally lower appetite)
- Iron and magnesium-rich recommendations
- Gentle exercise suggested

### Phase 2: Follicular (Days 6-13)

**What's happening hormonally:**
- Estrogen progressively rising
- FSH stimulates ovarian follicles
- Energy returning

**What you feel:**
- More energy and motivation
- Moderate appetite
- Better insulin sensitivity
- **This is your "superpower" period!**

**Nutritional strategy:**

| Approach | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Protein | Increase slightly (muscles respond better) |
| Carbs | Moderate, complex |
| Calorie deficit | Ideal period for a larger deficit |
| Exercise | Optimal time for intensity |

**What LOWIS adjusts:**
- Calorie goal optimized for weight loss
- More protein recommendations
- High-intensity exercise suggestions

### Phase 3: Ovulation (Days 14-16)

**What's happening hormonally:**
- Estrogen peak
- LH peak triggering ovulation
- Slight testosterone increase

**What you feel:**
- At your energy peak
- Often higher libido
- Increased confidence
- **Peak performance period**

**Nutritional strategy:**

| Approach | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Balance | Maintain follicular approach |
| Fiber | Help estrogen elimination |
| Cruciferous | Broccoli, cabbage (estrogen metabolism) |
| Hydration | Very important |

**What LOWIS adjusts:**
- Maintains optimized approach
- Fiber and cruciferous suggestions
- Suggested period for fitness challenges

### Phase 4: Luteal (Days 17-28)

**What's happening hormonally:**
- Progesterone dominates
- Estrogen drops then crashes
- Preparing for potential menstruation

**What you feel:**
- Increased appetite (+200-500 cal/day)
- Cravings for sugar, salt, fat
- Water retention (especially late phase)
- Sometimes unstable mood
- **The "difficult" phase for most**

**Nutritional strategy:**

| Approach | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Complex carbs | Slightly increase (sweet potato, brown rice) |
| Magnesium | Prevent cramps and cravings |
| Calcium + Vitamin D | Reduce PMS symptoms |
| Sodium | Limit to reduce retention |
| Don't over-restrict | Accept 100-200 extra calories |

**What LOWIS adjusts:**
- Slightly increased calorie goal (it's normal!)
- Satisfying but healthy recipes
- No guilt-tripping for cravings
- Reminder that displayed weight includes water retention

## The Scale Trap (and How to Avoid It)

Here's what a typical woman sees on her scale during a month:

```
Week 1 (period): -1.5 kg ✓ "It's working!"
Week 2 (follicular): -1 kg ✓ "Great!"
Week 3 (ovulation): -0.5 kg ✓ "Keep going..."
Week 4 (luteal): +2 kg ✗ "I'M QUITTING."
```

**The reality?** This woman lost 1 kg of fat. The +2 kg is water that will disappear in 3-5 days.

### The Solution: Weigh Yourself Smartly

**Option 1: Always at the same point in your cycle**
- Choose a fixed day (e.g., day 8 of each cycle)
- Compare these weigh-ins to each other

**Option 2: Daily weighing with trend analysis**
- LOWIS analyzes all your weigh-ins
- The AI distinguishes water retention from real weight loss
- You see the real trend, not fluctuations

## The 5 Mistakes Women Make (and How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Same calorie deficit all month

**The problem:** A -500 cal/day deficit is sustainable in the follicular phase but can trigger uncontrollable cravings in the luteal phase.

**The solution:** Cyclical deficit
- Follicular: -500 cal (significant deficit)
- Luteal: -200 cal (gentle deficit)
- **Result: Same monthly loss, zero binge-eating**

### Mistake 2: Feeling guilty about cravings

**The problem:** Your sugar cravings in the luteal phase are biological, not a willpower failure.

**The solution:** Prepare satisfying options
- 85% dark chocolate instead of candy
- Dates + peanut butter instead of cookies
- LOWIS "luteal phase" recipes designed to satisfy without derailing

### Mistake 3: Ignoring sleep and stress

**The problem:** [Poor sleep](/en/blog/sleep-weight-loss/) and high stress amplify hormonal symptoms and cravings.

**The solution:**
- Prioritize 7-8h of sleep in the luteal phase
- Relaxation techniques
- LOWIS adapts recommendations based on your stress and sleep levels

### Mistake 4: Training the same all month

**The problem:** Forcing intense HIIT during your period = exhaustion and injury risk.

**The solution:** Cyclical exercise
- Period: Yoga, walking, stretching
- Follicular: HIIT, intense strength training
- Ovulation: Peak performance, new records
- Luteal: Moderate, endurance

### Mistake 5: Comparing with men (or women on the pill)

**The problem:** Your friend/husband loses weight linearly. You don't. That's normal.

**The solution:** Compare yourself to yourself from cycle to cycle, not week to week.
