Gone are the days when counting calories took 15 minutes per meal. With LOWIS, **one photo is enough**.

In this guide, discover how to use the AI scanner to analyze your meals in 2 seconds — whether it's a homemade tagine, a lunchtime sandwich, or your favorite breakfast.

## Why photo scanning changes everything

### Before: The manual counting hassle

- Search for "chicken tagine" in a database
- Find 50 different results
- Estimate portions by eye
- Add up each ingredient
- **Time: 10-15 minutes**

### After: LOWIS scanning

- Take a photo
- AI analyzes
- **Time: 2 seconds**

It's that simple.

## How it works technically

### The AI behind the scan

LOWIS uses advanced artificial intelligence models to:

1. **Recognize the foods** in the image
2. **Identify portions** using visual references
3. **Calculate nutrients** based on our database
4. **Contextualize** with your profile (goals, preferences)

### The local database

Unlike American apps, LOWIS includes:

- **500+ Moroccan recipes**: Tagine, couscous, pastilla, rfissa, tanjia...
- **Traditional French dishes**: Quiche, cassoulet, ratatouille...
- **Local pastries**: Msemen, baghrir, chebakia, gazelle horns...
- **Street food**: Maakouda, skewers, sandwiches...

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1: Prepare your photo

For better recognition:

✅ **Good lighting** — Natural light is ideal
✅ **Top-down view** — Entire plate visible
✅ **No blur** — Sharp and clear image
✅ **Visible food** — No lid or packaging

❌ **Avoid**:
- Photos in the dark
- Extreme angles
- Multiple mixed plates
- Completely hidden dishes

### Step 2: Take the photo

1. Open the LOWIS app
2. Tap the "+" button
3. Select "Scan a meal"
4. Frame your plate
5. **Click!**

Analysis starts instantly.

### Step 3: Verify and adjust

The AI displays:

- **Detected foods** (e.g., "Chicken tagine with olives")
- **Estimated portions** (e.g., "1 standard serving")
- **Calories and macros** (proteins, carbs, fats)

If something isn't correct:

1. Tap the item to modify
2. Adjust the portion (+ or -)
3. Or replace with another food
4. Validate

**The AI learns from your corrections** and will be more accurate next time.

### Step 4: Save

One tap on "Confirm" and you're done!

The meal is added to your journal with all nutritional details.

## Tips for better recognition

### For composite dishes

If your plate contains multiple elements:

- Spread the foods slightly so they're visible
- Take the photo BEFORE mixing
- You can take multiple photos if needed

### For "hidden" dishes

Tagine with its lid on? Closed sandwich?

- Take a photo of the open/unfolded dish
- Or describe it orally (LOWIS also understands voice)

### For homemade recipes

Does your grandmother make the best couscous in the world?

- Scan it once
- Save it as a "favorite"
- Reuse it with one tap next time

## Special cases

### Beverages

The scanner also recognizes:
- Fresh juices
- Mint tea (with or without sugar)
- Coffee
- Smoothies

### Packaged snacks

Two options:
1. Scan the barcode (more accurate)
2. Scan the snack itself

### Restaurants

Recognition also works for:
- Fast food (with standard portions)
- Classic restaurants
- Takeaway food

## Beyond calories

The scan doesn't stop at calories. LOWIS also analyzes:

- **Macronutrients**: Proteins, carbs, fats
- **Fiber**: Important for satiety
- **Sugars**: Added vs natural
- **Sodium**: For those watching salt

This information feeds the personalized recommendations from your [AI coach](/en/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/).

## Comparison: LOWIS scan vs other methods

| Method | Time | Accuracy | Practicality |
|--------|------|----------|--------------|
| LOWIS scan | 2 sec | ±15% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Manual search | 5-15 min | ±20% | ⭐⭐ |
| Barcode only | 10 sec | ±5% | ⭐⭐⭐ (packaged only) |
| Eye estimate | 0 sec | ±40% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

"Perfect" accuracy doesn't exist — even dietitians make mistakes. What matters is **consistency** in tracking.

## Frequently asked questions about the scanner

### "The AI makes mistakes sometimes, right?"

Yes, and that's normal. No technology is 100% perfect.

But:
1. You can correct in 2 taps
2. The AI learns from your corrections
3. The average over a week is very accurate

### "Does it really work for tagine?"

Yes! It's one of our strengths. Our database was created with Moroccan and Mediterranean dishes as a priority.

### "What if I often eat the same thing?"

Even better! Your recent dishes are saved. One tap and it's recorded, without even scanning.

## Conclusion: Scan, stop counting

Calorie counting shouldn't be a part-time job.

With the LOWIS scanner:
- **2 seconds** instead of 15 minutes
- **Local dishes** recognized automatically
- **Learning** from your habits
- **More time** to live your life

The technology exists. Take advantage of it.
