faq:
  - question: "What is the LOWIS Audio Program?"
    answer: "It's a daily 5-10 minute audio program included in LOWIS. Based on the science of neuroplasticity, it helps transform your relationship with food by reprogramming the mental patterns that sabotage your weight loss efforts."
  - question: "Is it hypnosis?"
    answer: "No. The Audio Program uses scientifically validated techniques: guided visualization, mindfulness meditation, and neuroscience-based affirmations. You remain fully conscious and in control throughout the entire session."
  - question: "How long does it take to see results?"
    answer: "Neuroplasticity research shows that new habits can form in 21-66 days of regular practice. Most users notice changes in their eating behavior after 2-3 weeks of daily listening."
  - question: "Does the Audio Program replace therapy?"
    answer: "No. It's a complementary tool that helps with common aspects of the relationship with food. For diagnosed eating disorders or trauma, we recommend consulting a mental health professional."
  - question: "When should I listen to the Audio Program?"
    answer: "Ideally in the morning (to program your day) or in the evening before sleep (when the brain is more receptive). Some users also listen before high-risk moments: before a social meal, when stress rises, etc."

How many times have you started a diet with iron-clad motivation... only to abandon everything 3 weeks later?

It's not a lack of willpower. **It's a brain problem.**

Your brain has spent years creating neural connections around food: stress → chocolate, tiredness → sugar, reward → restaurant. These "mental highways" are hard to change with willpower alone.

**That's why LOWIS includes the Audio Program** — a unique tool that works directly on your brain to transform your relationship with food.

## Why Diets Fail (From the Brain's Point of View)

### The Problem Isn't What You Know

You probably know that:
- Too much sugar is bad
- Vegetables are good for health
- You need to eat less to lose weight

**If knowledge were enough, everyone would be thin.**

### The Real Problem: Unconscious Patterns

Your eating behavior is controlled 95% by your unconscious brain. These patterns have been formed by:

- Your childhood ("Clean your plate!")
- Your emotions ("Eat this, you'll feel better")
- Your habits ("I always have dessert")
- Your culture ("A meal without bread isn't a meal")

**These patterns are hardwired in your brain.** Willpower alone can't change them — you need to create new neural connections.

## The Science of Neuroplasticity

The good news? Your brain can change at any age. This is called **neuroplasticity**.

### How It Works

```
OLD PATTERN            →          NEW PATTERN
Stress = Eating        →          Stress = Breathing
Reward = Fast food     →          Reward = Pleasant activity
End of meal = Sugar    →          End of meal = Satisfaction
```

To create these new neural pathways, you need:
1. **Repetition** — Practice regularly (ideally daily)
2. **Receptive state** — The brain learns better when relaxed
3. **Visualization** — Imagining the behavior strengthens connections
4. **Positive emotions** — Emotional experiences anchor more strongly

**This is exactly what the Audio Program does.**

## How the LOWIS Audio Program Works

### Each session lasts 5-10 minutes and includes:

**1. Relaxation Phase (1-2 min)**
- Guided breathing
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Getting into a receptive state

**2. Reprogramming Phase (3-5 min)**
- Guided visualizations adapted to your goals
- Neuroscience-based affirmations
- Rewriting eating patterns

**3. Anchoring Phase (1-2 min)**
- Techniques to integrate new patterns
- Preparation for the day/week
- Gradual return to normal state

### Topics Covered

| Week | Topic | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Food awareness | Recognize real hunger vs emotional hunger |
| 2 | Releasing guilt | Stop the binge/guilt cycle |
| 3 | Stress management | Dissociate stress and food |
| 4 | Natural satisfaction | Feel full more easily |
| 5 | Body image | Improve your relationship with your body |
| 6 | Intrinsic motivation | Find lasting motivation |

## What the Audio Program Is NOT

### It's Not Hypnosis

You remain fully conscious and in control. No subliminal suggestion, no manipulation. Just visualization techniques validated by science.

### It's Not Magic

The Audio Program is a tool, not a magic wand. It works if you:
- Listen regularly (ideally daily)
- Are open to the process
- Use it alongside healthy eating

### It's Not Therapy Replacement

For severe eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder), consult a professional. The Audio Program helps with common challenges, not pathologies.

## Audio Program Specific FAQs

### "I can't meditate, will this work for me?"

The Audio Program isn't traditional meditation. You don't need to "empty your mind." You simply listen to a guided voice that does the work for you.

### "I have little time, is 5 minutes really enough?"

Yes. Studies show that short but regular sessions are more effective than long occasional ones. 5 minutes every day > 30 minutes once a week.

### "Does it work for men too?"

Absolutely. Neuroplasticity works the same way for everyone. Problematic eating patterns aren't a gender issue.

### "Can I listen in English, French, or Spanish?"

The Audio Program is available in French and English. A Spanish version is in development.
