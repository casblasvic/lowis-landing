## The Fundamental Difference

### Lose It!: The Simple Counter

Lose It! excels at one thing: counting calories simply.

**How it works:**
1. You set a weight goal
2. The app calculates your daily calories
3. You log what you eat
4. You try to stay under the limit

It's effective... at first. But **95% of users quit** because:
- Counting becomes tedious
- Results plateau
- No help understanding why

### LOWIS: The Intelligent Coach

LOWIS doesn't just count. It **understands and guides**.

**How it works:**
1. You scan your meal (2 seconds)
2. AI analyzes nutrients AND your context
3. The coach tells you what to adjust and why
4. The system adapts to your results

The difference? With LOWIS, you don't count blindly — you **understand** what works for your body.
