faq:
  - question: "Can you lose weight during Ramadan?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Ramadan fasting is naturally conducive to weight loss IF iftar and suhur are balanced. The problem often comes from excess during breaking the fast. With a smart approach, you can lose 2-4 kg during the month."
  - question: "What to eat at iftar to avoid weight gain?"
    answer: "Start with dates and water, then soup. Wait 15-20 minutes before the main course. Prioritize proteins and vegetables. Avoid fried foods and sweets in excess. Quantity matters as much as quality."
  - question: "Is suhur really important?"
    answer: "Suhur is CRUCIAL. It provides energy for the entire fasting day. Without suhur, you'll be hungry earlier, exhausted, and risk overeating at iftar. Even if light, never skip it."
  - question: "How much water to drink during Ramadan?"
    answer: "Aim for 2-2.5L between iftar and suhur. Distribute: 2-3 glasses at iftar, 2-3 glasses after tarawih, 2-3 glasses at suhur. Avoid drinking a lot at once — it dilutes digestive juices and causes bloating."

Ramadan is approaching. And like every year, you're asking yourself the same question: **how to fast without gaining weight, without being exhausted, and while maintaining your energy?**

This guide gives you all the keys to a healthy Ramadan — whether you want to lose weight, maintain it, or simply live this blessed month well.

## The Ramadan Paradox

### Why Many Gain Weight

Fasting should logically lead to weight loss. Yet many gain weight. Why?

**Classic mistakes:**
- Iftar too heavy to "compensate"
- Excess fried foods and sweets
- Snacking between iftar and suhur
- Skipped or too light suhur
- Insufficient hydration

### Ramadan Can Be Your Ally

With the right approach, Ramadan fasting becomes a powerful transformation tool:
- **Natural fast**: 14-16h without eating = fat-burning mode activated
- **Two meals**: Easier to control than three
- **Spirituality**: Additional motivation to take care of your body

## The Perfect Iftar

### The Optimal Breaking Order

The order in which you eat at iftar **changes everything**.

**Stage 1: Traditional breaking (0-5 min)**
- 2-3 dates
- 1 glass of water or milk

**Stage 2: The sacred wait (5-20 min)**
- Maghrib prayer
- Or simply waiting

**Stage 3: The soup (20-30 min)**
- Harira, chorba, or vegetable soup

**Stage 4: The main course (30-45 min)**
- Proteins (meat, fish, legumes)
- Vegetables
- Reasonable amount of carbohydrates

**Stage 5: Dessert (optional, moderate)**
- Fresh fruit preferably
- Traditional pastry in small amounts

### Iftar Star Foods

| Food | Benefit | Suggested Amount |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Dates | Quick energy, fiber | 2-3 |
| Harira | Hydration, plant proteins | 1 bowl |
| Eggs | Complete proteins | 1-2 |
| Avocado | Good fats, satiety | 1/2 |
| Raw vegetables | Fiber, vitamins | 1 handful |
| Chicken/Fish | Lean proteins | 100-150g |

## Strategic Suhur

### Why Suhur is NON-NEGOTIABLE

Suhur is not optional. It's **the most important meal** of Ramadan.

**Without suhur:**
- Hunger from 10am
- Intense fatigue
- Headaches
- Overeating at iftar

**With a good suhur:**
- Energy until Maghrib
- Preserved concentration
- Stable mood

### The Ideal Suhur

**The three pillars of suhur:**

1. **Proteins** (long-lasting satiety)
   - Eggs, cheese, Greek yogurt

2. **Fiber** (slow energy release)
   - Oats, whole grain bread, fresh fruits

3. **Good fats** (stable energy)
   - Avocado, almonds, olive oil

**Example of perfect suhur:**
- 2 scrambled eggs
- 1 slice of whole grain bread + avocado
- 1 plain yogurt
- 1 banana
- Almonds (a handful)
- 2-3 glasses of water

## Hydration: The Secret of Happy Fasters

### Goal: 2-2.5L per night

| Moment | Amount | Type |
|--------|--------|------|
| Breaking (dates) | 1 glass | Water |
| During iftar | 2 glasses | Water, soup |
| After tarawih | 2-3 glasses | Water, light tea |
| Before bed | 1 glass | Water |
| Suhur | 2-3 glasses | Water |

### Signs of Dehydration

⚠️ **During the day:**
- Very dry mouth
- Headaches
- Dark urine in the evening
- Extreme fatigue
- Dizziness

## Special Ramadan Weight Loss Plan

### Realistic Goal

During Ramadan, aim for a loss of **0.5-1 kg per week**.

### Smart Deficit

**Simple calculation:**
- Calculate your normal needs (LOWIS does this for you)
- Reduce by 300-500 kcal
- Distribute between iftar and suhur

## Physical Activity During Ramadan

### When to Train

**Best time: 1-2h after iftar**
- Stomach not too full
- Energy available
- Ability to rehydrate after

**Acceptable: Just before iftar**
- If you're used to it
- Light training only

### Recommended Exercise Type

| Type | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Walking | Daily | 20-30 min |
| Light weights | 2-3x/week | 30-45 min |
| Yoga/Stretching | 2-3x/week | 20 min |
