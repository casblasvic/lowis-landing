You lost 10 kg. Congratulations! Six months later, you've regained 12. It's the story of millions of people.

**The rebound effect is not inevitable.** It's a predictable biological phenomenon — and avoidable if you understand how it works.

## What is the rebound effect?

The rebound effect (or yo-yo effect) is weight regain after a diet, often **more than the starting weight**.

### The scary numbers

- **95%** of people regain the lost weight within 5 years
- **66%** regain more than they lost
- Metabolism can remain slowed for up to **6 years** after a diet

It's not the people's fault. It's biology.

## Why your body "betrays" you

### Survival mode activates

When you drastically reduce calories, your body thinks "famine":

| What happens | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Metabolism slows | You burn fewer calories at rest |
| Ghrelin increases | You're hungrier |
| Leptin decreases | You feel less satisfied |
| Thyroid slows | Less energy, fatigue |
| Cortisol increases | Easier fat storage |

### Fat memory

Your fat cells don't disappear when you lose weight. They **shrink** and patiently wait to fill up again.

After restriction, they become **more efficient** at storing fat. It's an ancient survival mechanism.

### Hormones remain imbalanced

Even after reaching your target weight, your hunger hormones remain elevated for **several months, even years**.

That's why maintaining weight is often **harder** than losing it.

## Mistakes that guarantee the rebound effect

### Mistake #1: Losing too fast

The faster you lose, the more violent the rebound will be.

- 1000 kcal/day diets → Rebound guaranteed
- Loss of 3+ kg/week → Metabolism destroyed
- "30-day challenges" → Marketing, not health

### Mistake #2: Stopping the diet abruptly

Going from 1200 to 2000 kcal overnight = immediate regain.

Your metabolism doesn't have time to adapt.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the stabilization phase

Most diets stop at "congratulations, you've reached your goal!"

But that's where the real work begins.

### Mistake #4: Weighing yourself every day

Daily fluctuations (water, hormones, digestion) create anxiety and compulsive behaviors.

## The 5 strategies to avoid the rebound effect

### Strategy 1: Moderate deficit

Never create a deficit of more than **500 kcal/day**.

| Deficit | Expected loss | Rebound risk |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 250-500 kcal | 0.5-1 kg/week | Low |
| 500-750 kcal | 1-1.5 kg/week | Moderate |
| 750+ kcal | 1.5+ kg/week | High |

### Strategy 2: Progressive loss

Maximum **1 kg per week**, ideally 0.5-0.75 kg.

Yes, it's slower. But it's forever.

### Strategy 3: The stabilization phase

After reaching your goal:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Add 100 kcal/day
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Add another 100 kcal/day
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Adjust according to the scale
4. **Then**: Find your maintenance

This phase should last **minimum 4-6 weeks**.

### Strategy 4: Physical activity (but not to burn)

Exercise isn't for "burning calories" (it's inefficient).

It serves to:
- Preserve muscle mass
- Maintain metabolism
- Improve insulin sensitivity
- Regulate hunger hormones

### Strategy 5: Long-term support

The biggest success factor: **not being alone**.

That's why an [AI coach that follows you over time](/en/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/) makes all the difference.

## How LOWIS prevents the rebound effect

### Early detection

The AI analyzes your data and detects warning signs:

- Slowing weight loss
- Increased cravings
- Energy drop
- Compensation patterns

### Automatic adjustments

When these signs appear, LOWIS adjusts:

- Increases calories before you crack
- Proposes strategic "refeed" days
- Adapts macros according to your metabolism

### Post-goal tracking

Reaching your weight is just the beginning. LOWIS continues to support you during the critical stabilization phase.

## Warning signs to watch for

### During the diet

- Chronic fatigue
- Uncontrollable cravings
- Plateau longer than 3 weeks
- Obsessive thoughts about food

### After the diet

- Rapid regain (>1 kg in one week)
- Compulsive behaviors
- Feeling of "no longer being able to control"
- Guilt after every meal

If you recognize these signs, it's time to recalibrate — not give up.

## Conclusion: The rebound effect is not inevitable

The rebound effect is **predictable and avoidable** if you:

1. Avoid extreme diets
2. Lose weight progressively
3. Respect the stabilization phase
4. Maintain physical activity
5. Get long-term support

**True success isn't losing weight. It's never regaining it.**
