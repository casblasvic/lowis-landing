faq:
  - question: "What is the rebound effect exactly?"
    answer: "The rebound effect (or yo-yo effect) is the phenomenon of weight regain after a diet, often with additional pounds. It's caused by the body's metabolic adaptations to caloric restriction."
  - question: "Why do you regain more weight than before the diet?"
    answer: "After restriction, your metabolism is slowed but your appetite is increased. Hunger hormones (ghrelin) are elevated and satiety hormones (leptin) are low. Your body becomes more efficient at storing fat 'just in case.'"
  - question: "How to avoid the rebound effect?"
    answer: "The keys are: 1) Never create too large a caloric deficit (max 500 kcal/day), 2) Lose weight slowly (max 1 kg/week), 3) Do a stabilization phase, 4) Maintain physical activity, 5) Get long-term support."
  - question: "How long does the stabilization phase last?"
    answer: "The stabilization phase should last at least 4 to 6 weeks. During this period, you gradually increase your calories while monitoring your weight. It's a crucial step that most diets ignore."

You lost 10 kg. Congratulations! Six months later, you've regained 12. It's the story of millions of people.

**The rebound effect is not inevitable.** It's a predictable biological phenomenon — and avoidable if you understand how it works.

## What is the rebound effect?

The rebound effect (or yo-yo effect) is weight regain after a diet, often **more than the starting weight**.

### The scary numbers

- **95%** of people regain the lost weight within 5 years
- **66%** regain more than they lost
- Metabolism can remain slowed for up to **6 years** after a diet

It's not the people's fault. It's biology.

## Why your body "betrays" you

### Survival mode activates

When you drastically reduce calories, your body thinks "famine":

| What happens | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Metabolism slows | You burn fewer calories at rest |
| Ghrelin increases | You're hungrier |
| Leptin decreases | You feel less satisfied |
| Thyroid slows | Less energy, fatigue |
| Cortisol increases | Easier fat storage |

### Fat memory

Your fat cells don't disappear when you lose weight. They **shrink** and patiently wait to fill up again.

After restriction, they become **more efficient** at storing fat. It's an ancient survival mechanism.

### Hormones remain imbalanced

Even after reaching your target weight, your hunger hormones remain elevated for **several months, even years**.

That's why maintaining weight is often **harder** than losing it.

## Mistakes that guarantee the rebound effect

### Mistake #1: Losing too fast

The faster you lose, the more violent the rebound will be.

- 1000 kcal/day diets → Rebound guaranteed
- Loss of 3+ kg/week → Metabolism destroyed
- "30-day challenges" → Marketing, not health

### Mistake #2: Stopping the diet abruptly

Going from 1200 to 2000 kcal overnight = immediate regain.

Your metabolism doesn't have time to adapt.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the stabilization phase

Most diets stop at "congratulations, you've reached your goal!"

But that's where the real work begins.

### Mistake #4: Weighing yourself every day

Daily fluctuations (water, hormones, digestion) create anxiety and compulsive behaviors.

## The 5 strategies to avoid the rebound effect

### Strategy 1: Moderate deficit

Never create a deficit of more than **500 kcal/day**.

| Deficit | Expected loss | Rebound risk |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 250-500 kcal | 0.5-1 kg/week | Low |
| 500-750 kcal | 1-1.5 kg/week | Moderate |
| 750+ kcal | 1.5+ kg/week | High |

### Strategy 2: Progressive loss

Maximum **1 kg per week**, ideally 0.5-0.75 kg.

Yes, it's slower. But it's forever.

### Strategy 3: The stabilization phase

After reaching your goal:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Add 100 kcal/day
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Add another 100 kcal/day
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Adjust according to the scale
4. **Then**: Find your maintenance

This phase should last **minimum 4-6 weeks**.

### Strategy 4: Physical activity (but not to burn)

Exercise isn't for "burning calories" (it's inefficient).

It serves to:
- Preserve muscle mass
- Maintain metabolism
- Improve insulin sensitivity
- Regulate hunger hormones

### Strategy 5: Long-term support

The biggest success factor: **not being alone**.

That's why an [AI coach that follows you over time](/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/) makes all the difference.

## How LOWIS prevents the rebound effect

### Early detection

The AI analyzes your data and detects warning signs:

- Slowing weight loss
- Increased cravings
- Energy drop
- Compensation patterns

### Automatic adjustments

When these signs appear, LOWIS adjusts:

- Increases calories before you crack
- Proposes strategic "refeed" days
- Adapts macros according to your metabolism

### Post-goal tracking

Reaching your weight is just the beginning. LOWIS continues to support you during the critical stabilization phase.

## Warning signs to watch for

### During the diet

- Chronic fatigue
- Uncontrollable cravings
- Plateau longer than 3 weeks
- Obsessive thoughts about food

### After the diet

- Rapid regain (>1 kg in one week)
- Compulsive behaviors
- Feeling of "no longer being able to control"
- Guilt after every meal

If you recognize these signs, it's time to recalibrate — not give up.

## Conclusion: The rebound effect is not inevitable

The rebound effect is **predictable and avoidable** if you:

1. Avoid extreme diets
2. Lose weight progressively
3. Respect the stabilization phase
4. Maintain physical activity
5. Get long-term support

**True success isn't losing weight. It's never regaining it.**
