faq:
  - question: "Why don't free calorie apps work?"
    answer: "Free apps make money from ads and your data, not from your results. They offer generic databases, no personalized coaching, and leave you alone with numbers without context."
  - question: "What's the real cost of a free app?"
    answer: "A 'free' app costs you about 15 min/day in manual searching (7.5h/month). If your time is worth $10/h, that's $75/month in wasted time, not counting the months without results that delay your goals."
  - question: "How is a paid app different?"
    answer: "With a paid app, the company has an interest in your success. You benefit from quick scanning (2 sec vs 15 min), an active AI coach, 40+ indicators analyzed, human nutritionists, and a local food database."
  - question: "How do I know if my current app isn't working?"
    answer: "Telltale signs: you've installed 5+ different apps, you always give up after a few weeks, you count calories but don't lose weight, you spend more time on the app than eating."

You downloaded a free calorie counting app. You started with motivation. Two weeks later, you gave up.

**It's not your fault.** The problem is the very model of these applications.

## The Problem with "Free"

Let's start with a simple economic truth: **if it's free, you're the product**.

Free apps make money in two ways:
1. **Advertising**: Ads between every action
2. **Your data**: Sold to third parties

Neither of these options incentivizes them to actually help you lose weight. On the contrary: the longer you stay on the app without results, the more money they make.

### The Real Cost of "Free"

| What you think | The reality |
|----------------|-------------|
| It's free | You pay with your time |
| It does the job | It does the minimum |
| I'm saving money | You're losing months without results |

## The 5 Reasons These Apps Fail

### 1. Manual Food Searching

Have you ever tried to find "chicken tagine with preserved lemons" in an American database?

**The result:**
- 15 minutes searching
- You give up and enter "chicken" randomly
- Your calories are completely wrong

Free apps have generic databases, mainly American. If you eat French, Moroccan, or simply homemade dishes, good luck.

### 2. No Coaching, Just Numbers

These apps give you a number: "You consumed 1847 kcal today."

And then? **Radio silence.**

- No advice on what to improve
- No explanation for why you're not losing weight
- No adaptation to your situation

You're alone with numbers that mean nothing.

### 3. The Obsessive Counting Trap

Paradoxically, these apps can create an unhealthy relationship with food:

- You count every bite
- You feel guilty for every slip
- You develop food anxiety
- You quit from mental exhaustion

This isn't health, it's obsession.

### 4. Unverified Data

Do you know who fills in free app databases? **The users themselves.**

Result:
- "Apple" can show 50, 80, or 120 kcal depending on the entry
- Uncorrected typos
- Inconsistent portions

You're conscientiously counting... false data.

### 5. No Evolution with You

Your body changes. Your metabolism adapts. Your needs evolve.

A free app? It gives you the same advice as day 1, even after 3 months.

## The Model That Actually Works

The difference between an app that doesn't work and one that transforms your life comes down to one word: **guidance**.

### What a Real Nutrition Tool Does

| Free app | Smart tool |
|----------|-----------|
| Records calories | Analyzes 40+ indicators |
| Generic database | Local dishes included |
| Leaves you alone | Active AI coach |
| Same advice for everyone | Continuous personalization |
| Intrusive ads | Smooth experience |

### Why Paying Makes the Difference

When you pay for a service, the company has a **vested interest in your success**.

- Your results = their reputation
- Your satisfaction = their growth
- Your success = their marketing

It's an alignment of interests that doesn't exist with the free model.

## The Real Calculation: Time vs Money

Let's do an honest calculation.

**With a free app:**
- 15 min/day of manual searching = 7.5h/month
- Frustration and quitting after 1-2 months
- 0 lasting results

**With a smart tool:**
- 2 min/day = 1h/month
- Guidance that maintains motivation
- Visible and lasting results

If your time is worth $15/hour, the "free" app costs you **$110/month in lost time**.

## Signs It's Time to Change

Do you recognize these situations?

- You've installed 5+ different apps
- You start motivated and always quit
- You count calories but don't lose weight
- You spend more time on the app than eating
- You feel guilty for every slip

If you checked more than 2 boxes, the problem isn't you. It's the tool.

## The Alternative: Why LOWIS Is Different

LOWIS isn't an improved calorie counting app. It's a **complete nutritional guidance system**.

### What Changes Everything:

**1. 2-Second Scanning**
Take a photo. The AI recognizes the dish, even a tagine or couscous.

**2. Active AI Coach**
Not just numbers, but personalized advice based on YOUR situation.

**3. 40+ Indicators Analyzed**
Calories, yes, but also [stress](/blog/stress-weight-loss/), [sleep](/blog/sleep-weight-loss/), hydration, [hormonal cycle](/blog/menstrual-cycle-weight-loss/)...

**4. Human Nutritionists**
Your plan is validated by real experts, not just an algorithm.

**5. Local Database**
Regional dishes, traditional recipes, local specialties... Everything is there.

### The Real Question

It's not "Can I afford a paid tool?"

It's "Can I afford to lose another 6 months with apps that don't work?"
