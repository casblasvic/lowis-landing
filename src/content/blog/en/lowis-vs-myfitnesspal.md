  - question: "What's the main difference between LOWIS and MyFitnessPal?"

LOWIS is an <a href='/blog/ai-nutrition-coach-how-it-works/'>active AI coach</a> that analyzes <a href='/blog/40-indicators-weight-loss/'>40+ health indicators</a> including <a href='/blog/sleep-weight-loss/'>sleep</a> and <a href='/blog/stress-weight-loss/'>stress</a>."
  - question: "Is MyFitnessPal really free?"

  - question: "Why are users leaving MyFitnessPal?"
    answer: "Features became paid, manual entry is time-consuming, advice is generic. LOWIS <a href='/blog/scan-meal-2-seconds/'>scans meals in 2 seconds</a> and provides personalized coaching. It's <a href='/blog/why-diets-fail/'>why passive diets fail</a>."
  - question: "Does MyFitnessPal track menstrual cycle?"
    answer: "No. The <a href='/blog/menstrual-cycle-weight-loss/'>menstrual cycle</a> affects weight significantly. LOWIS tracks it with <a href='/blog/40-indicators-weight-loss/'>40+ indicators</a>. Read our <a href='/blog/smart-weight-loss-guide/'>complete guide</a> for women."
  - question: "How do I avoid weight rebound after MyFitnessPal?"
    answer: "Calorie counting alone leads to the <a href='/blog/avoid-weight-rebound/'>rebound effect</a>. LOWIS includes the <a href='/blog/audio-program-reprogram-brain/'>Audio Program</a> for lasting mental changes — the 80% of success most apps ignore."

MyFitnessPal. The app everyone knows. With over 200 million users, it's the undisputed giant of calorie counting.

But after years of controversial changes — features going behind paywalls, invasive advertising, personal data being sold — **more and more users are looking for an alternative**.

In this article, we honestly compare LOWIS and MyFitnessPal to help you choose the app that will **actually** help you reach your goals.

## The 30-Second Summary

| Criteria | LOWIS | MyFitnessPal |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Price** | 7 days free, then ~$12/week | Limited free, Premium ~$90/year |
| **AI Photo Scan** | ✅ Recognizes complete meals | ❌ Not available |
| **Barcode Scanner** | ✅ Free | ⚠️ Paid since 2022 |
| **Indicators Tracked** | 40+ (sleep, stress, cycle...) | Calories + macros only |
| **Personalized Coaching** | ✅ Active AI + nutritionists | ❌ Generic advice |
| **Local Food Database** | ✅ 500+ regional recipes | ⚠️ User-generated (errors) |
| **Personal Data** | ✅ Protected | ⚠️ Sold to third parties |

## The MyFitnessPal Story: From Innovation to Frustration

MyFitnessPal revolutionized calorie counting in 2005. Its huge database and active community made it the go-to app.

But since its acquisition by Under Armour in 2015 (then sold to Francisco Partners in 2020), things have changed:

### What Has Frustrated Users

**2022: Barcode scanner becomes paid**
> "That was THE free feature. Now you have to pay to scan a yogurt." — TrustPilot Review

**Ads everywhere**
> "The app has become unusable with all these ads. I lose 30 seconds closing pop-ups before every entry." — Reddit r/loseit

**Personal data sold**
> "I found out MFP sells my data to insurers and brands. Makes you think." — Health Forum

**Generic advice**
> "After 3 years of use, the app gives me the same advice. It doesn't know me." — User Review

If you recognize yourself in these frustrations, you're not alone. That's why [so many people are looking for an effective alternative](/blog/how-to-choose-nutrition-app/).

## The Real Difference: Diary vs Coach

### MyFitnessPal: A (Very) Detailed Food Diary

MyFitnessPal does well what it was created for: **recording what you eat**.

The typical process:
1. You search for each food in the database
2. You manually adjust portions
3. The app calculates your calories and macros
4. You see if you're meeting your goals
5. **That's it.**

The app never tells you:
- Why you're not losing weight despite a calorie deficit
- How to adapt your diet to your stress level
- What impact your poor sleep has on your metabolism
- What to eat tomorrow to reach your goals

**You do the work. The app takes notes.**

### LOWIS: A Coach That Works for You

LOWIS takes a radically different approach:

1. **You scan** — One photo, 2 seconds, even a complete tagine
2. **The AI analyzes** — Not just calories, but 40+ health indicators
3. **The coach recommends** — "You slept poorly, here's how to adapt your diet today"
4. **The system learns** — Your corrections improve future analyses
5. **Nutritionists validate** — Your plan is verified weekly by experts

**The AI works for you. Not the other way around.**

## The Real Cost: Time + Money + Results

### The Calculation Nobody Makes

MyFitnessPal Premium costs ~$90/year. LOWIS costs ~$12/week. On the surface, MyFitnessPal wins.

But let's calculate the **real cost**:

#### Time Spent with MyFitnessPal

| Activity | Time/Day | Time/Month |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Food searching | 10-15 min | 5-7h |
| Portion correction | 5 min | 2.5h |
| Macro verification | 5 min | 2.5h |
| **Total** | **20-25 min** | **10-12h** |

If your time is worth $15/hour, that's **$150-180 of time lost per month**.

#### Time Spent with LOWIS

| Activity | Time/Day | Time/Month |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Photo scan | 30 sec × 3 meals | 45 min |
| Reading recommendations | 3-5 min | 2-3h |
| **Total** | **5-7 min** | **3-4h** |

**Monthly savings: 6-8 hours of your life.**

### The Hidden Cost of "Free" MyFitnessPal

MyFitnessPal's free version has hidden costs:

1. **Advertising** — Time lost + stress from pop-ups
2. **Sold data** — Your health information with third parties
3. **Missing features** — No barcode scanner, limited analysis
4. **Frustration** — The app constantly reminds you to upgrade

**Average time per meal**:

## What Users Who Switched Say

> "After 5 years on MyFitnessPal, I was spending more time entering data than eating. LOWIS saved me 1 hour a day." — Sophie, 38, Paris

> "The day the barcode scanner became paid, I looked for an alternative. LOWIS does it better with photo scanning." — Ahmed, 45, Casablanca

> "I couldn't take the ads anymore. And when I learned MFP was selling my health data... I switched that same day." — Marc, 41, Toronto

## Our Honest Verdict
