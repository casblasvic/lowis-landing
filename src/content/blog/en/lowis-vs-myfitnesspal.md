faq:
  - question: "What's the main difference between LOWIS and MyFitnessPal?"
    answer: "The fundamental difference is the approach: MyFitnessPal is a passive food diary where you do all the work, while LOWIS is an active AI coach that analyzes 40+ health indicators and personally guides you toward your goals."
  - question: "Is MyFitnessPal really free?"
    answer: "MyFitnessPal's free version has been very limited since 2022: the barcode scanner is now paid, ads are everywhere, and advanced features require Premium (~$90/year). LOWIS offers a full 7-day free trial, then a transparent subscription."
  - question: "Why are users leaving MyFitnessPal?"
    answer: "According to TrustPilot and Reddit reviews, the main reasons are: features that became paid, time-consuming manual entry, generic advice, and personal data sold to third parties. LOWIS offers an alternative with instant AI photo scanning and personalized coaching."
  - question: "Does MyFitnessPal recognize local dishes?"
    answer: "MyFitnessPal has a user-generated database with many errors. Dishes like tagine, couscous, or regional specialties are often poorly referenced or missing. LOWIS includes 500+ Moroccan recipes and comprehensive databases of French and international dishes validated by nutritionists."
  - question: "Can I import my MyFitnessPal data to LOWIS?"
    answer: "LOWIS doesn't require any import. From day one, you scan your meals with photos and the AI creates your nutritional profile. Your MyFitnessPal history isn't necessary because LOWIS adapts in real-time to your current habits."
  - question: "Does LOWIS really use AI?"
    answer: "Yes, LOWIS uses advanced AI models for every analysis. Unlike MyFitnessPal which is a simple counter, LOWIS analyzes your overall situation (sleep, stress, hormonal cycle, digestion) and provides personalized recommendations in real-time."

MyFitnessPal. The app everyone knows. With over 200 million users, it's the undisputed giant of calorie counting.

But after years of controversial changes — features going behind paywalls, invasive advertising, personal data being sold — **more and more users are looking for an alternative**.

In this article, we honestly compare LOWIS and MyFitnessPal to help you choose the app that will **actually** help you reach your goals.

## The 30-Second Summary

| Criteria | LOWIS | MyFitnessPal |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Price** | 7 days free, then ~$12/week | Limited free, Premium ~$90/year |
| **AI Photo Scan** | ✅ Recognizes complete meals | ❌ Not available |
| **Barcode Scanner** | ✅ Free | ⚠️ Paid since 2022 |
| **Indicators Tracked** | 40+ (sleep, stress, cycle...) | Calories + macros only |
| **Personalized Coaching** | ✅ Active AI + nutritionists | ❌ Generic advice |
| **Local Food Database** | ✅ 500+ regional recipes | ⚠️ User-generated (errors) |
| **Personal Data** | ✅ Protected | ⚠️ Sold to third parties |

## The MyFitnessPal Story: From Innovation to Frustration

MyFitnessPal revolutionized calorie counting in 2005. Its huge database and active community made it the go-to app.

But since its acquisition by Under Armour in 2015 (then sold to Francisco Partners in 2020), things have changed:

### What Has Frustrated Users

**2022: Barcode scanner becomes paid**
> "That was THE free feature. Now you have to pay to scan a yogurt." — TrustPilot Review

**Ads everywhere**
> "The app has become unusable with all these ads. I lose 30 seconds closing pop-ups before every entry." — Reddit r/loseit

**Personal data sold**
> "I found out MFP sells my data to insurers and brands. Makes you think." — Health Forum

**Generic advice**
> "After 3 years of use, the app gives me the same advice. It doesn't know me." — User Review

If you recognize yourself in these frustrations, you're not alone. That's why [so many people are looking for an effective alternative](/blog/how-to-choose-nutrition-app/).

## The Real Difference: Diary vs Coach

### MyFitnessPal: A (Very) Detailed Food Diary

MyFitnessPal does well what it was created for: **recording what you eat**.

The typical process:
1. You search for each food in the database
2. You manually adjust portions
3. The app calculates your calories and macros
4. You see if you're meeting your goals
5. **That's it.**

The app never tells you:
- Why you're not losing weight despite a calorie deficit
- How to adapt your diet to your stress level
- What impact your poor sleep has on your metabolism
- What to eat tomorrow to reach your goals

**You do the work. The app takes notes.**

### LOWIS: A Coach That Works for You

LOWIS takes a radically different approach:

1. **You scan** — One photo, 2 seconds, even a complete tagine
2. **The AI analyzes** — Not just calories, but 40+ health indicators
3. **The coach recommends** — "You slept poorly, here's how to adapt your diet today"
4. **The system learns** — Your corrections improve future analyses
5. **Nutritionists validate** — Your plan is verified weekly by experts

**The AI works for you. Not the other way around.**

## The Real Cost: Time + Money + Results

### The Calculation Nobody Makes

MyFitnessPal Premium costs ~$90/year. LOWIS costs ~$12/week. On the surface, MyFitnessPal wins.

But let's calculate the **real cost**:

#### Time Spent with MyFitnessPal

| Activity | Time/Day | Time/Month |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Food searching | 10-15 min | 5-7h |
| Portion correction | 5 min | 2.5h |
| Macro verification | 5 min | 2.5h |
| **Total** | **20-25 min** | **10-12h** |

If your time is worth $15/hour, that's **$150-180 of time lost per month**.

#### Time Spent with LOWIS

| Activity | Time/Day | Time/Month |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Photo scan | 30 sec × 3 meals | 45 min |
| Reading recommendations | 3-5 min | 2-3h |
| **Total** | **5-7 min** | **3-4h** |

**Monthly savings: 6-8 hours of your life.**

### The Hidden Cost of "Free" MyFitnessPal

MyFitnessPal's free version has hidden costs:

1. **Advertising** — Time lost + stress from pop-ups
2. **Sold data** — Your health information with third parties
3. **Missing features** — No barcode scanner, limited analysis
4. **Frustration** — The app constantly reminds you to upgrade
