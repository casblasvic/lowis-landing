faq:
  - question: "What is the best nutrition app in 2026?"
    answer: "The best app depends on your needs. For complete tracking with active AI and 40+ health indicators, LOWIS is recommended. For simple calorie counting, other apps may suffice. The key is choosing an app you'll actually use."
  - question: "Are free nutrition apps effective?"
    answer: "Free apps offer basic features but have limits: intrusive ads, incomplete databases, no personalization. 73% of free app users quit within the first 2 weeks."
  - question: "How long does it take to see results with a nutrition app?"
    answer: "With a suitable app and regular tracking, first results appear in 2-3 weeks. The key is consistency: an app that saves you time (like photo scanning) increases your chances of persevering."
  - question: "Can a nutrition app replace a nutritionist?"
    answer: "A good app like LOWIS complements a nutritionist's work by ensuring daily tracking. Some apps even include expert validation. For specific medical conditions, always consult a professional."

You've downloaded 3 different nutrition apps this year. With the first one, you lasted 5 days. The second, 2 weeks. The third is still on your phone, but you haven't opened it in a month.

**It's not a motivation problem. It's a tool choice problem.**

With over 500 nutrition apps in the stores, how do you know which one will *actually* work for you? In this guide, we'll cover the criteria that make the difference between an app that gathers dust and an app that changes your life.

## The Real Problem: Why You Quit

### It's Not You, It's the App

Let's start with a statistic that should reassure you: **73% of users abandon their nutrition app within the first 14 days**.

The reasons are always the same:

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Manual food search | 15+ minutes per day lost |
| Incomplete database | Your dishes don't exist |
| Same advice for everyone | Not adapted to YOUR life |
| Complicated interface | Frustration → abandonment |
| Intrusive ads | Degraded experience |

### The Hidden Cost of "Bad Choices"

Every abandoned app isn't just lost time. It's:

- **Wasted motivation**: You had the momentum, the app killed it
- **Sometimes money**: Non-refunded premium subscriptions
- **Eroded confidence**: "Apps don't work for me"

The truth? Apps work. But not just any app, and not for just anyone.

## The 7 Criteria for Choosing the Right App

### Criterion 1: Logging Speed

**Question to ask**: How long does it take to log a meal?

- ❌ **Bad sign**: Manual search through an endless list
- ✅ **Good sign**: Photo scan, voice recognition, or barcode

**Why it's crucial**: If logging a meal takes 5 minutes, you won't do it. The best apps reduce this time to a few seconds.

> With AI photo scanning, LOWIS recognizes your plate in 2 seconds — including traditional dishes like tagine or couscous.

### Criterion 2: Local Database

**Question to ask**: Does the app know the foods I eat?

- ❌ **Bad sign**: You search "fish and chips" and find "fried fish with potatoes"
- ✅ **Good sign**: Your traditional recipes are in the database

**Why it's crucial**: An American app will never understand British, Mediterranean, or Asian cuisine. You'll spend your time creating custom foods.

### Criterion 3: Real Personalization

**Question to ask**: Does the app adapt to MY life?

- ❌ **Bad sign**: Same calorie goal for everyone
- ✅ **Good sign**: Considers sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, activity...

**Why it's crucial**: Your body isn't a calorie machine. Your metabolism varies based on your sleep, stress, and hormonal cycle. An app that ignores these factors gives you generic — and ineffective — advice.

### Criterion 4: Active vs Passive Coaching

**Question to ask**: Does the app tell me what to do, or does it just record?

| Passive app | Active app |
|-------------|-----------|
| Records your meals | Analyzes your habits |
| Shows graphs | Recommends actions |
| Leaves you alone | Accompanies you |

**Why it's crucial**: An app that just records what you eat won't help you change. You need a coach, not a notebook.

### Criterion 5: User Experience

**Question to ask**: Is it pleasant to use?

- ❌ **Bad sign**: Cluttered interface, ads everywhere
- ✅ **Good sign**: Clean design, intuitive navigation

**Why it's crucial**: You'll use this app 3-5 times a day. If the experience is frustrating, you'll quit — even if the app is "technically good."

### Criterion 6: Business Model

**Question to ask**: How does the app make money?

| Model | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| Free with ads | You are the product |
| Limited freemium | Essential features are paid |
| Clear subscription | You pay for the service |
| Free trial | You can test before paying |

**Why it's crucial**: "Free" doesn't really exist. Either you pay with money, or you pay with time (ads), or you pay with personal data. Choose with full knowledge.

### Criterion 7: Support and Community

**Question to ask**: What happens if I have a problem?

- ❌ **Bad sign**: No contact button, minimal FAQ
- ✅ **Good sign**: Responsive support, active community, experts available

**Why it's crucial**: You'll have questions. You'll encounter obstacles. An app that leaves you alone with these difficulties has little chance of leading you to success.

## How to Evaluate an App in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick test to do before committing:

### The 5-Meal Test

1. **Download the app** (free version or trial)
2. **Log 5 typical meals** from your week
3. **Time** the total duration
4. **Note** the frustrations encountered

**Results**:
- Less than 10 minutes total → The app is usable
- 10-20 minutes → Think carefully
- More than 20 minutes → Move on

### Questions to Ask Yourself

After the test, ask yourself:

1. Were my favorite dishes in the database?
2. Did the app give me personalized advice?
3. Do I want to open it tomorrow?

If you answer "no" to any of these questions, this app probably isn't for you.

## Quick Comparison of Popular Apps

| Criterion | Free apps | Classic premium apps | LOWIS |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Fast logging | ⚠️ Variable | ✅ Barcode scan | ✅ AI photo scan |
| Local database | ❌ US-centric | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ 500+ local recipes |
| Personalization | ❌ Basic | ⚠️ Calories only | ✅ 40+ indicators |
| Active coaching | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ AI + experts |
| Support | ❌ Non-existent | ⚠️ Email | ✅ Chat + experts |

## Mistakes to Absolutely Avoid

### Mistake #1: Choosing by Star Rating

Store ratings are often biased:
- Apps encourage ratings after a "success" (which is just a beginning)
- Frustrated users uninstall without rating
- Fake reviews exist

**Do this**: Read recent negative reviews. They're the most revealing.

### Mistake #2: Trusting Influencers

A paid influencer will always speak well of the app they're promoting.

**Do this**: Look for reviews from ordinary users on Reddit, TrustPilot, or forums.

### Mistake #3: Wanting Everything Free

A free app that costs 15 minutes a day actually costs you **7+ hours per month** of your time.

**Do this**: Calculate the value of your time. A subscription that saves you 10 hours a month is an investment, not an expense.

## Conclusion: The Best App Is the One You Use

There's no perfect app for everyone. But there IS one perfect app for YOU.

This app:
- **Respects your time** with fast logging
- **Understands your culture** with an adapted database
- **Adapts to your life** with real personalization
- **Accompanies you** with active coaching
- **Respects you** with a transparent business model

Don't settle for downloading a random app. Take 5 minutes to really test it. It's the best investment you can make for your health.
