        "question": "How does LOWIS, your personal AI coach, work?",
        "answer": "LOWIS is your personal AI coach that monitors 40+ indicators in real-time. It's not a simple chatbot. When LOWIS detects changes in your sleep, stress, or emotional state, it automatically adjusts your meal plan. But LOWIS isn't alone: our team of experts reviews your progress every week and manually refines your plan. It's the combination of AI + humans that makes the difference."
      },
      {
        "question": "What exactly are the 40+ monitored indicators?",
        "answer": "LOWIS monitors: NUTRITION (calories, protein, carbs, fats, 22 micronutrients), HEALTH (sleep, stress, digestion, pain, hydration), PHYSIOLOGY (weight, measurements, physical activity, menstrual cycle for women), BEHAVIOR (personal notes, special events, how you feel). While MyFitnessPal only counts calories, LOWIS sees the complete picture."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why track 22 micronutrients and not just calories?",
        "answer": "Calories only tell part of the story. The 22 micronutrients (vitamins A, B, C, D, E, K, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium...) are essential for: ENERGY (iron fights fatigue), METABOLISM (B vitamins burn fat), IMMUNITY (vitamin C and zinc protect you), SKIN and HAIR (biotin and zinc). An invisible deficiency can sabotage your weight loss even with a perfect calorie deficit. LOWIS detects these deficiencies and adjusts your diet."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the intelligent food scan work?",
        "answer": "Just take a photo of your plate or a product's barcode. LOWIS AI automatically identifies the foods, estimates portions, and calculates complete nutritional values (calories, macros AND 22 micronutrients). For Moroccan dishes like tajine or couscous, our specialized database recognizes typical ingredients. No manual searching — photograph and continue your day."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does LOWIS analyze my personal notes?",
        "answer": "LOWIS understands your real life. In the app, you can write or record notes about: your stress, special events (dinner, trip, celebration), new symptoms, or obstacles. BOTH the LOWIS AI AND our expert team read your notes: LOWIS analyzes instantly and adjusts your plan, then your expert coach reviews it the following week. You're not a number, you're a person that LOWIS understands."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do other diets fail but LOWIS doesn't?",
        "answer": "Classic diets give you a rigid plan and leave you alone. 95% of people regain lost weight. LOWIS is different: we monitor 40+ indicators, LOWIS adapts to your daily life like a personal coach, and our experts adjust weekly. It's 360° support, not just a meal list."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the free first week work?",
        "answer": "Simply fill out your profile to personalize your plan based on your 40+ indicators. Full access for one week, no credit card required. See the results before you decide. After, continue at 199 DH/week or do nothing — your choice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is losing 1 to 2.5 kg per week really possible?",
        "answer": "Yes, that's our guaranteed goal. By eating smart (not less, just better combined), most of our users achieve these results. The LOWIS protocol optimizes each meal according to your metabolism."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I have allergies or dietary restrictions?",
        "answer": "During the initial onboarding, you indicate all your allergies, intolerances, and dietary preferences. LOWIS integrates them into your meal plan. The system will NEVER recommend foods you can't eat. You can update your restrictions at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I feel changes (beyond weight)?",
        "answer": "Tangible results per week: Weight: 1-2.5 kg/week (guaranteed). Energy: many report +25% in 3-5 days. Digestion: noticeable improvement in 1-2 weeks. Mental clarity: reduced stress in 5-7 days. Overall well-being: emotional difference in 2 weeks. The key: LOWIS adapts your plan every day based on how you feel, not just numbers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I have to follow a strict diet to lose weight?",
        "answer": "No. LOWIS is not a restrictive diet. You keep your favorite dishes — tajines, brochettes, grilled fish — we teach you to combine them smartly. Lasting habits, not unsustainable efforts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the app recognize Moroccan dishes?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Over 500 Moroccan recipes: chicken tajines, kefta brochettes, grilled fish, mechoui, grilled sardines... Each dish analyzed with nutritional precision. Designed for Moroccan cuisine, not adapted after."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference with calorie counters?",
        "answer": "Calorie counters leave you alone with numbers. LOWIS monitors 40+ indicators (sleep, stress, cycle, digestion...), LOWIS reacts instantly like a personal coach, and our nutritionists adjust your plan weekly. Real support, not a calculator."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does LOWIS adapt during Ramadan?",
        "answer": "Special plans optimized for fasting: ideal ftour/shour distribution, adapted hydration, and recommendations to maintain your energy. The app automatically adapts to your rhythm during the holy month."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I slip up one day?",
        "answer": "It's expected and normal. LOWIS immediately corrects the trajectory without guilt. A slip doesn't destroy your progress — we adjust together and keep going. Zero judgment, only solutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel whenever I want?",
        "answer": "Yes, 1-click from the app. No commitment, no penalty. You keep access until the end of your period. The first week is free without credit card — you decide after seeing the results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the real difference between LOWIS and other apps?",
        "answer": "Calorie counters (MyFitnessPal, Yazio) give you numbers and leave you alone. LOWIS is different: 1) COMPLETE MONITORING: 40+ indicators vs just calories, 2) AUTOMATIC ADAPTATION: LOWIS adjusts your plan when you sleep poorly, are stressed, or have an event, 3) HUMAN EXPERTS: our nutritionists review your case every week, 4) LOCAL CUISINE: 500+ Moroccan recipes analyzed, not an American database. It's an intelligent personal coach + expert team, not a calculator."
